# Super Jelly Racer
I decided to Change the name to Jelly Racer to simplify it. The submission process was a little tough to learn. I did have to learn about key managers and version codes to be able to submit.
I did have some Identity verification problems with Google Play, but after the 4th try, I got into the publishing stage for internal testing. Overall it's ready for testing and I've already received good feedback 
for the game from my testers. Platform I thought it would be easier on google play just because it's cheaper and less of a nitpick.
